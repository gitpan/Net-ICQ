Net::ICQ

This is a really unfinished module for communicating with an ICQ
server.

*** YOU CAN'T USE IT YET.  IT'S NOT FINISHED.  IT JUST BARELY
    LOGS IN AND WON'T RUN OR ANYTHING.

    It's here because others are helping me create it and this
    is the easient way to share code :)


INSTALLING
==========

After unzipping and untarring the distribution directory, you install
the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


CONTACTS
========

   To contact me directly, <URL:mailto:gossamer@tertius.net.au> is
   best.
   
   The icq-dev mailing list is for all the ICQ clones being developed,
   see http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-mih/icq/#icq-devel for
   details.

   There is an icq-perl mailing list specifically for people with an
   interest in Net::ICQ.  Anybody interested in helping with
   development or testing is encouraged to subscribe, as are people
   who just want to keep track of what's going on with Net::ICQ.  It's
   a standard majordomo list - to subscribe, send 'subscribe' to
   icq-perl-request@tertius.net.au.  To post, address your message to
   icq-perl@tertius.net.au.
