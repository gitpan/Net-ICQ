Net::ICQ

This is a really unfinished module for communicating with an ICQ
server.

*** YOU CAN'T USE IT YET.  IT'S NOT FINISHED.
    BUT IT'S GETTING THERE!!

    It's here because others are helping me create it and this
    is the easient way to share code :)


CHANGES
=======

Most recent changes are:
0.07 -> 0.08
   - dword_2_hex renamed dword_to_chars to match other names.
   - utility function decimal_to_hex added.
   - Example client now uses config files, sorta.
   - Added new 'Birthday' status.
   - New skeleton function receive_end_contactlist_status(),
     receive_not_logged_in().
   - Added new server packet 0xF000, NOT_LOGGED_IN.
   - Altered logon sequence according to what Graham Roff
     <graham@modemcable149.173.mmtl.videotron.net> posted to the list
     about it.
   - Renamed some packet types (and associated functions, etc.) to be 
     more clear:  
        LOGIN_1 to REQUEST_OFFLINE_MESSAGES, 
        REPLY_X1 to END_CONTACTLIST_STATUS, 
        REPLY_X2 to END_OFFLINE_MESSAGES, 
        CMD_X1 to ACK_OFFLINE_MESSAGES,

After unzipping and untarring the distribution directory, you install
the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


CONTACTS
========

   To contact me directly, <URL:mailto:gossamer@tertius.net.au> is
   best.
   
   The icq-dev mailing list is for all the ICQ clones being developed,
   see http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-mih/icq/#icq-devel for
   details.

   There is an icq-perl mailing list specifically for people with an
   interest in Net::ICQ.  Anybody interested in helping with
   development or testing is encouraged to subscribe, as are people
   who just want to keep track of what's going on with Net::ICQ.  It's
   a standard majordomo list if you grok them, or trot along to
   http://www.tertius.net.au/lists/icq-perl/ to subscribe with a nifty
   web interface.
