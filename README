Net::ICQ


This is a really unfinished module for communicating with an ICQ
server.

This is being constructed using the ICQ specification at:
   http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-mih/icq/

Please note: 
   I am in no way affiliated with Mirabilis!

   This is an unofficial module and not acknowledged, supported or
   condoned by Mirabilis in any way.


Contacting me:  
   <URL:mailto:gossamer@tertius.net.au> is best, or the icq-dev
   mailing list, see
   http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-mih/icq/#icq-devel for details.
