Net::ICQ

This is a really unfinished module for communicating with an ICQ
server.

*** YOU CAN'T USE IT YET.  IT'S NOT FINISHED.  IT JUST BARELY
    INSTALLS AND WON'T RUN OR ANYTHING.

    It's here because others are helping me create it and this
    is the easient way to share code :)


INSTALLING
==========

After unzipping and untarring the distribution directory, you install
the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
