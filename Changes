0.02.1 -> 0.03
   - Fixed the pack/unpack functions.
   - Program looks for environment variables ICQHOST and ICQPORT if
     not specified in constructor arguments or configuration file.
   - All the calls to construct_message() and send_message() were wrong.
     Oops.
   - Bunch of other stuff.  It compiles now :).
   - Swapped username to 'uin' in code to make it clearer.

0.02 -> 0.02.1
   - Remembered I'm supposed to be keeping a changelog :)
   - Added some skeleton functions and documentations.
