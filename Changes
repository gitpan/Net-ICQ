(NB:  See Credits section of the README for expansion of the
      names in [...], all the ones without square brackets were
      done by Bek Oberin.)

0.06 -> 0.07
   - Added separate TODO file.
   - Added a bunch more debug output.
   - SILENT_TOO_LONG packet now handled and replied too with a
     KEEPALIVE packet.
   - Made sure every function always returns some value.
   - packet_waiting now accepts a timeout argument.
   - Many changes to example client, it's now almost functional!

0.05 -> 0.06
   - Makefile now checks for IO::Select, Carp, Sys::Hostname, 
     Data::Dumper and IO::Socket since people reported them
     missing and I'm not sure when each of them became stardard
     Perl modules.
   - Fixed packet number for GO_AWAY packet.
   - Better debugging info when unknown packet received.
   - Added TRY_AGAIN server packet type.

0.04 -> 0.05
   - Added new argument, $status, to constructor.
   - Updated README file, added info about icq-dev@tertius.net.au.
   - New file, README.developers with code comments.
   - [Jah] Removed find_incoming_port() which shouldn't have been
     there in the first place.
   - [Jah] Added dword_2_chars() function to convert to intel endian 
     format.
   - [Jah] Fixed construct_message() so that it wouldn't increment 
     the sequence number when it really shouldn't.
   - [Jah] Added LOGIN packet information to the login() function.
   - search() now groks "Lastname, Firstname" as a name.
   - Removed send_ack from receive_login_reply - it's already been sent
     at that point.
   - Cleaned up incoming_process_packet() a bit and changed the long
     if/elsif set to use a coderef to find the method for each packet.
   - Removed config file stuff - it's something the client should do,
     not the library.
   - Added "TODO" everyplace the code desperately needs frobbing, so
     you can see with a search what needs to be done.

0.03 -> 0.04
   - Croak if we can't find a password or UIN.
   - Added a bunch of debugging printouts.
   - Fixed the socket stuff in incoming_process_packet().
   - Changed stray 'warn's and 'die's to carp/croak.

0.02.1 -> 0.03
   - Fixed the pack/unpack functions.
   - Program looks for environment variables ICQHOST and ICQPORT if
     not specified in constructor arguments or configuration file.
   - All the calls to construct_message() and send_message() were wrong.
     Oops.
   - Bunch of other stuff.  It compiles now :).
   - Swapped username to 'uin' in code to make it clearer.

0.02 -> 0.02.1
   - Remembered I'm supposed to be keeping a changelog :)
   - Added some skeleton functions and documentations.
