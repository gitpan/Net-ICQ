0.12
====

oops, didn't keep track.  check cvs if you care.  :)  we can pull the
cvs log entries in here in the future...


0.13
====

fixed status code length in CMD_USER_ONLINE (from 2 bytes to 4); implemented
Tyler Goen's code for SRV_STATUS_UPDATE with the correct 4 byte status

removed @_hex_table since it's not needed anymore

Squashed bug (minor) in _do_acks

enabled contact list send and receive

added debug print for add_handler, cleaned up other debug prints, fixed
do_multis so it removes multis from the queue after processing them

added perl 5.6 check to Makefile.PL


0.14
====

fixed stupid syntax error in ICQ.pm (did that go into a release...?)
and updated test.pl to be more clear and enlightening

fixed dumb Makefile.PL error, wasn't actually checking for Time::Local before

made cmd_codes and srv_codes public

wrote the CLIENT EVENTS section in pod

added test2.pl


0.15
====

Set status in the CMD_LOGIN packet to ONLINE instead of 0x200

Modified behavior when a bad session id or uin is found in a server packet: now _connected
is set to 0, and it won't croak(). (thanks Banda)

Applied Bek Oberin's fix to SRV_RECV_MESSAGE to calculate the month correctly.

Fixed an undefined value issue in _str_to_bytes (thanks again to Bek for noticing).

Changed SRV_RECV_MESSAGE code to call SRV_SYS_DELIVERED_MESSAGE for the bulk of the
processing, instead of cut-and-pasting its code.

added %status_codes

Implemented Germain Malenfant's fix for CMD_SEARCH_UIN.

Implemented Dimitar Peikov's fix to make _bytes_to_str correctly handle strings containing
a '0' character. (boy was that a dumb bug on my part :)

Modified debug output of incoming packets to also display the command number in <>
brackets, after the dump of the param bytes.

Fixed add_handler debug statement

Added Nezar Nielsen's code to handle web-pager and email-pager messages.

Applied Nezar Nielsen's fixes to make SRV_FOUND_USER work right, as well as make
SRV_INFO_REPLY and SRV_EXT_INFO_REPLY work in the first place.

Fixed problem with the same event being sent multiple times by the server because of lagged
acks.
